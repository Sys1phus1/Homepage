# Sunkai LYU (吕荪恺）

I am currently a senior undergraduate student at School of Mathematical Science(SMS), Peking University, majoring Biostatistics, and will begin my doctoral studies in Industrial Engineering and Decision Analytics (IEDA) at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology next September.

I have a solid understanding of probability and statistics, with current research interests focusing on large-scale model inference and stochastic process analysis.
